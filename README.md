# eatbeercrawl

Eat. Beer. Crawl. is a mobile app that allows users to create food and beer crawls on the fly. Users join using a Google account to authenticate. Once authenticated, the app pulls your information from Google such as your name and picture. When the user initially launches the app, they are shown crawls in progress based on proximity. The user can choose the join an existing crawl, or create a new crawl. If the user joins an existing crawl a notification is sent to existing crawl members, and the itinerary is sent to the new member. If the user is creating a new crawl, they are able to enter parameters. You are prompted to name the crawl, build your crawl team (i.e. send invites to specific app members), define what food or alcohol you want to search for, the number of locations you want to hit, the start date/time, approximate end date/time, and then how crazy the crawl is anticipated to get. Based on these parameters, the app will select your crawl locals and arrange them for you. You can get directions to each location from within the app, or coordinate transportation using Uber.
